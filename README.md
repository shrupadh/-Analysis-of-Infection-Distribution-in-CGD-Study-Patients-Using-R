# STAT Project Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the STAT Project  assignment. The assignment focuses on analyzing the `cgd` dataset from the `survival` package in R, involving data manipulation, preliminary study, and detailed data analysis to understand the distribution of infections among patients enrolled in a study.

## Files
- `shrupadh.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the complete analysis, from data preprocessing to final analysis.
- `shrupadh.pdf`: PDF document generated from the R Markdown file, containing all the output and plots.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to run the analysis.

## Requirements
- R (version used for this assignment: ["R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt)"])
- R packages:
  - `knitr`
  - `vcd`
  - `tidyverse`
  - `dplyr`
  - `survival`
  
Ensure you have installed all required packages before running the analysis. You can install missing packages using R commands like `install.packages("package_name")`.

## Running the Analysis
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the `shrupadh.Rmd` file in RStudio.
3. Run the R Markdown file to reproduce the analysis. This will generate a new `shrupadh.pdf` file with the latest results.

## Assignment Details
The analysis covers several key points:
- A preliminary study of the `cgd` dataset to understand basic characteristics such as sample size, number of infection episodes, and distribution of treatments.
- Detailed data analysis to explore the distribution of infections experienced by patients, using statistical distributions and graphical methods like hanging rootograms.
- Application of statistical distributions to estimate probabilities and other key statistics related to the infections.
